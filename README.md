# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install required packages

```bash
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Install iOS pods

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Step 4: Start your Application

### Follow instructions from the Metro Bundler

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
